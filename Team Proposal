Title: Inflammation and Microbiome Composition on Anemic Infants In Peru
Introduction and Background:

Determination of both CRP and AGP concentrations may be important because they reflect different phases of the acute phase response that range from acute infection to chronic inflammation

CRP: https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/133708/WHO_NMH_NHD_EPG_14.7_eng.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y 
 normally found at concentrations of less than 10 mg/L in the blood
During infectious or inflammatory disease states, CRP levels rise rapidly within the first 6 to 8 hours and peak at levels of up to 350–400 mg/L after 48 hours
CRP levels are unaffected by anaemia, protein levels, red blood cell shape or patient age or sex
AGP levels rise more slowly in response to inflammation or infection and remain elevated longer than CRP levels
This first international standard for human CRP serves as a reference source of defined biological activity expressed in an internationally agreed unit, being assigned a value of 0.049 mIU/ampoule


AGP: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7185229/ 
Serum AGP concentrations typically range from 0.4 – 1.2 mg/mL, but have been reported as high as approximately 3 mg/mL [15]. AGP rises more slowly and stays elevated longer than CRP; which can be used together to determine the stage and severity of inflammation, and has been suggested as a marker of long-term or chronic inflammation [6]. An AGP cutoff of 1.0 mg/mL has been used to adjust biomarkers of nutritional status for inflammation, however regression approaches have used concentrations of inflammatory biomarkers as continuous variables

BRINDA
Some of the key questions
Do we need to measure biomarkers of inflammation when assessing micronutrient status?
Do we need to measure more than one inflammation biomarker (CRP and/or AGP)?
Brinda; Elevated CRP was defined as a CRP concentration >5 mg/L. Elevated AGP was defined as an AGP concentration >1 g/L. AGP, α-1-acid glycoprotein; 
 we showed a more-consistent and higher magnitude of significant positive associations between stunting and elevated AGP than between stunting and elevated CRP, which potentially reflects AGP’s role as a marker of long-term inflammation as opposed to acute inflammation 



Research Objectives:
What is the relationship between inflammation and microbiome diversity for 6 and 12 months infants?
Experimental Aims:
To use measurements of CRP and AGP to determine which infants in the dataset qualify for inflammation
To determine how microbiome composition differs between infants with and without inflammation
To investigate if the differences in microbiome composition are further diversified between different sexes and different age groups
To determine if there are any links between inflammation / microbiome with anemia 
(BRINDA) to compare
Microbiome diversity with infant datasets from other countries - geographical differences/regional? 
trends/correlations between anemia, CRP, and AGP

KNOWLEDGE GAP: since we need to determine what statistics will equal inflammation, how are we going to balance the CRP and AGP reads?

Questions for Avril




Proposed Approach/Methods
Might want to use indicator taxa to find taxa that are present in infants with vs. without inflammation
Chi square method? Probably can use it for something in our paper

Controls
Remove subjects with parasites
Remove anemia subjects


https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6733848/
Microbial diversity and waz
Taxa associated with inflammatory biomarkers
Association of microbiota maturity or diversity with biomarkers of inflammation at 6 and 18 mo of age
THEY HAVE DATA 
Sequence data: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJEB29433 
Did subjects at 6, 12, 18 months




Look at (and compare)
Find what is significant in terms of inflamm levels and diversity, then examine whatever is significant
Look at whether taxa at 6 m (or 12) are associated with AGP(or CRP) concentration 
Are there any OTUs that are negatively or positively related to AGP at 6 or 12 m




1A: Is there a difference in gut microbial composition between infants with and without inflammation

6month analysis
AND
12month analysis
AND 
6-12 month shift 

Follow up - are there any species that are associated with inflammation? 
Is AGP or CRP associated with stunting? Or wasting? 
Waz and whz

(does inflammation correlate with stunted growth)
Is inflammation an indication of anemia and is it linked with the microbiome? 
Are the correlations seen similar to the BRINDA analysis conclusions? OR TO another study’s conclusions
1A.1 Import and demultiplex raw sequence reads






1A.2 Quality control































































Other ideas
There is some evidence that breastfeeding for longer could affect crp levels. Maybe we could compare 12month infants with diets (including vs not including BM) and see if there is a relationship
