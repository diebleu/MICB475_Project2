Team 8 Lab Notebook
MICB475
Mari Aiko Job, Zee Muradi, Carly Pistawka, Janet Wuu


6 month olds or 12 months old for both datasets
Male vs Female?
Lifestyle characteristics between geographical populations (Peru vs. USA)
Diet composition (BM, BM+solids, BM+liquids)


Comparison of 6 months vs. 12 months across different populations (Infant vs Anemia)
Changes from 6 month to 12 month (microbial diversity shift) -




Previous paper in UJEMI: Exclusive breastfeeding may decrease overall diversity of the infant gut microbiome with a shift towards dominance of bacterial taxa associated with lactose metabolism

Potential Project 2 Research Questions

Meeting Minutes
Github for the code / lab notebook ? 
Keep them in separate files
Think of a research question and bring it to the next team meeting
Only two team meetings left before we have to submit proposal
Build on more complicated project 
Cannot pool data together -- but can use 6m and 12m both in analysis but as different groups
Combine 2+ datasets? Find metadata categories that overlap this may be cool to look at
Anemia and infant feeding preferences may have overlap in categories
Both have samples at 6month and 12m
Both give info on diets - BM or ‘combined’ (BM and Liquids and/or solids
Could have more subquestions

For next meeting
Decide on what platform to use for lab notebook
Finalize topic and research question?
