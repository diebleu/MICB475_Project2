Team 8 Lab Notebook
MICB475
Mari Aiko Job, Zee Muradi, Carly Pistawka, Janet Wu


6 month olds or 12 months old for both datasets
Male vs Female?
Lifestyle characteristics between geographical populations (Peru vs. USA)
Diet composition (BM, BM+solids, BM+liquids)


Comparison of 6 months vs. 12 months across different populations (Infant vs Anemia)
Changes from 6 month to 12 month (microbial diversity shift) -




Previous paper in UJEMI: Exclusive breastfeeding may decrease overall diversity of the infant gut microbiome with a shift towards dominance of bacterial taxa associated with lactose metabolism

TA Supervisor: Avril Metcalfe-Roach (avril.metcalfe-roach@msl.ubc.ca) 

31/01/23  W4 TM - Week 4 Team Meeting

Agenda
1. Meet and get to know Professor and TA supervisor.
2. Discuss what the expectations are for Project 2. 
3. Talk about potential Project 2 topics.

Potential Project 2 Research Questions

Meeting Minutes
Github for the code / lab notebook ? 
Keep them in separate files
Think of a research question and bring it to the next team meeting
Only two team meetings left before we have to submit proposal
Build on more complicated project 
Cannot pool data together -- but can use 6m and 12m both in analysis but as different groups
Combine 2+ datasets? Find metadata categories that overlap this may be cool to look at
Anemia and infant feeding preferences may have overlap in categories
Both have samples at 6month and 12m
Both give info on diets - BM or ‘combined’ (BM and Liquids and/or solids
Could have more subquestions



Anemia paper link: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30351381/

For next meeting
Decide on what platform to use for lab notebook
Finalize topic and research question?
CC Evelyn on email re: platform we decide on




07/02/2023 W5 TM - Week 5 Team Meeting

Agenda
1. Let TA Supervisor know about decision to use GitHub as the platform for lab notebook.
2. Discuss potential topics and research questions for Project 2. 

Meeting Minutes
GitHub for Desktop
Two avenues -> lifestyle differences (Peru vs United States), comparing 6 and 12 months infants for both Peru and US (looking at differences and similarities between populations) 
Make sure that datasets can be comparable, double check methodology that can affect microbiome
Check supplementary materials 
Adding a lot of questions in proposals is better
We are thinking of moving away from diet since there is a UJEMI paper that used the “Eating Behavior in Infants” dataset
Add another variable to our question → maybe female vs male?
Flesh out ideas on what information we have right now
Start on proposal as soon as possible
Differential abundance testing - DESeq2 
Can look at diversity metrics and generate table that compares study 1 vs study 2 (then 6 months vs 12 months + descriptions) 
Piecrust2 - to annotate  
Can check Nature papers to see how other authors explain their methodology?
Controlling for variables - remove effects of other variables that will affect the ones you are studying (filtering them out?)

Do we have methods and supplementary/anything for the feeding preference paper???
Reach out to one or two of groups that have already published using dataset 
Continue conversation with authors that we are in contact with
May be a difficult study to work with since there is no publication
If ends up being huge issue, we can just use the one dataset
Ask evelyn how to find more information

Inflammatory effects in the microbiome (anemia paper)
Crp (c reactive protein) = inflammatory marker
Look at stage of infection - how many samples do we have that we could use
Check if any other categories are inflammation-related

For next meeting
Start proposal looking only at anemia dataset
Check methodology we want to use
Check formatting for paper
Finalize research question as soon as possible
Start on DESeq? 
Work on the proposal as much as we can
Process data via qiime2 
Up to importing data to R
Create OTU Table
Look at the papers that use the infant dataset

Have a rough draft of proposal, do qiime2 stuff, DESeq2 
Doesn’t have to be perfect, just something to start with


In future: we will need to create ‘table 1’
collect all info and summarize it up
number males and females, number 12m vs 6m
 different variables that overlap
